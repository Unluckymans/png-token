## Solidity code for the Png Token smart contract

This code is for a capped, mintable, burnable, ERC-20 token.

The token specifics are as follows:

## Total Capped Supply:  
1,192,258,185 PNG tokens (total token emission is over 50 years), tokens are burnt each quater with a % of Pngme's profits. When Pngme is in pre-profit stage a minimum a quarterly repurchase and burn will be executed after a public announement. The amount of repurchase will be defined and published publically once known.

## Definitions: 

- Treasury Fund: This is a token fund that is used to compensate the founders, advisors, and serves as a long-term growth fund for the development of the Png Network. 

- Incentive Distribution: Token rewards ussed to users who signup to the Pngme mobile application. 

- Savings Distribution: Token rewards issued to users on the network who stake tokens in the Pngme mobile application savings account.
